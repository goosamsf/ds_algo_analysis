### Problem : 
Implementation of BFS , #bfs #tree 


### From : Leet Code Blind 75

---
### Problem Prompt
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).


---
### Approach & Analysis
> Implement the BFS(Level order traversal)

---
### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while(!q.empty()){
            int qLen = q.size();
            vector<int> level;
            for(int i= 0; i<qLen; i++){
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if(node){
                    
                    level.push_back(node->val);
                    q.push(node->left);
                    q.push(node->right);
                }
                
            }
            if(!level.empty()){
                res.push_back(level);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};


```

#### Major Mistakes I made
Line 26, I thought `root` need to be inserted before while loop but it's not.

Line 32, Inner loop is necessary to traverse all elements in the same level. Number of times of iteration in the inner loop should be the size of the current queue.

Line 36, I thought it is not allowed for `null` to be inserted into queue but it is actually possible.
