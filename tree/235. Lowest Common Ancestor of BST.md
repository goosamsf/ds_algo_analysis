### Problem Prompt
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”


---
### Approach & Analysis
> Think about three cases :
>  1. `p` and `q` are in the right subtree of the `root`
>  2. `p` and `q` are in the left subtree of the `root`
>  3. else : either `p` or `q` is root and the other is either in left or right.

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        TreeNode* ans = NULL;
        while (cur !=NULL){
            if(p->val > cur->val && q->val > cur->val ){
                cur = cur->right;
            }
            else if( p->val < cur->val && q->val < cur->val){
                cur = cur->left; 
                   
            }
            else{
                ans = cur;
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
