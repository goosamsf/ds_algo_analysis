### Problem Prompt
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

### Approach & Analysis
>if(left_node and right_node are not NULL)
>return current node
>if(left is NULL) return right
>else return left

---
### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(!root) return root;
        if(root==p || root == q) return root;
        
        TreeNode* leftist = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left,p,q);
        TreeNode* rightwing = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right,p,q);
        
        
        return (leftist && rightwing) ? root : !leftist ? rightwing : leftist; 
    }
};
