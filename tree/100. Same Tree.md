### Problem Prompt
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.


---
### Approach & Analysis
> if two nodes are both NULL, it happens to be true

> if previous condition didn't satisfy but if only either one is NULL , it happen to be false

> if two previous conditions didn't satisfy but if two values that each node is pointing to is different, it happens to be false

**At this point, two values that each node is pointing to are same**
> If none of the previous condition satisfied at all, see how two node's left child and right child do by calling function recursively

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution{
    public :
        bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q){
            if(p==NULL && q==NULL){
                return true;
            }
            if(p==NULL || q==NULL){
                return false;
            }
            if(p->val != q->val){
                return false;
            }

            return isSameTree(p->left,q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
        }
};




```
