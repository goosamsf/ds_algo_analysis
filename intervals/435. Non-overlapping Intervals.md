### Problem : 
Introduction to Greedy approach, 
Think about what greedy claim is.
In this problem, the greedy claim is that `we have to remove one that ends later ` This let us make a locally optimal decision(By removing one that ends later, we can reduce the chance of overlap of coming intervals.) which will lead us global solution. this is the paradigm of greedy approach. 

### From :
#greedy #interval #medium

---
### Problem Prompt
Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.


---
### Approach & Analysis
>Interval Problem Template :
>1 .Sort Interval by first time. 
>2. Iterate loop check if next interval's start time happen before current interval's end time
>	1. If it does, it means overlap, take an appropriate action.
>	2. else,  it doesn't, it means  it doesn't overlap, take appropriate action as well.

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(),intervals.end()); 
        int res = 0;
        int prev_end = intervals[0][1];
        
        for(int i = 1; i<intervals.size(); i++){
            int start = intervals[i][0];
            int end = intervals[i][1];
            
            if(start >= prev_end){
                prev_end = end;
            }
            else{
                res++;
                prev_end = min(end, prev_end);
            }
            
        }
        return res;
    }
};




```

#### Major Mistakes I made
Sort is prerequisite of this problem. Without sort, the algorithm doesn't  compute right output.


---
##### Time and Space Complexity
Sort takes  : log(N)
Iterate list of intervals takes  : N

Total :
(N)log(N)
