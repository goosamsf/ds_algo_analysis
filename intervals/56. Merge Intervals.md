### Problem : 
When it comes to `intervals` problem, sorting comes into really handy. For example, for given intervals, sorting by `start time.`
would give you an ability to iterate given list from index 0 to end. Once you sort the list,  all you are going to do is to check if it's overlapped and if it does, merge. And repeat this process as many as the size of the list.
### From :
#interval #medium 

---
### Problem Prompt
Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.


---
### Approach & Analysis
>1. Create an empty list that would return as an answer.
>2. sort the given list.
>3. Iterate the sorted list from index to size of it.
>	- if overlapped, merge and append to ans
>	- else append to ans

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end()); 
        res.push_back(intervals[0]);
        for(int i = 1; i< intervals.size(); i++){
            int last = res.size()-1;
            if(intervals[i][0] <= res[last][1]){
                
                vector<int> temp;
                temp.push_back(min(res[last][0],intervals[i][0]));
                temp.push_back(max(res[last][1],intervals[i][1]));
                res.erase(res.end()-1);
                res.push_back(temp);
                
            }
            else{
                res.push_back(intervals[i]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
