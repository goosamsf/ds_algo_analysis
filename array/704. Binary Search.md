### Problem Prompt
Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Approach & Analysis
>Unlike the approach that I was taught in school : using recursion, this is iterative approach. It's good problem to understand binary search. I think iterative approach is more intuitive than recursion.

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
       int first = 0;
       int last = nums.size() - 1;
        
       while( last >= first){
           int mid = (first + last) / 2;
           if(nums[mid] > target){
               last = mid - 1;
           }
           else if(nums[mid] < target){
               first = mid + 1;
           }
           else {
               return mid;
           }
       }
        
        return -1;
    }
};




```
