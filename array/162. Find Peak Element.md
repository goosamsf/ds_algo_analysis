### Problem : 
Binary search works because we are asked to find any local maximum value not the global maximum. Basically, pick mid and see if it is small than next element, if it does go right other wise go left
#array  #binarysearch

### Problem Prompt
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Approach & Analysis
>Binary Search 
>The implementation solution doesn't seem right but it works because of two facts : 
>	1. Outside of the boundary is all -INF
>	2. local peak value is acceptable. (If it was to be asked to find global peak, it should be thought about it again.)

### Implementation Solution
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right  = nums.size() -1;
        
        while(left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(nums[mid]  <  nums[mid+1]){
                left  = mid +1;
            }
            else {
                right = mid;
            }
            
        }
        return left;
         
        
    }
};



```

#### Major Mistakes I made
Notice that returning address is in `left`

##### Time and Space Complexity
