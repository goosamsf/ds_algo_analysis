#array #medium 
extension of two sum problem.

### Problem Prompt
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Approach & Analysis
> 1. Sort the list 
> 2. Loop through keep tracking three variables 
> 		1.  `i` : traverser of outer loop
> 		2.  `left` : one of the two pointers
> 		3.  `right` : the other of two pointers
>  *The problem limit the duplicated answer*
>   `sort` come into play to cope with situation where non sorted spread elements can randomly generate duplicated answer.
>   If it's sorted, we can cope with by comparing previous element and if it's same increment `left` pointer.

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans; 
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        for(int i = 0; i< nums.size(); i++){
            if(i>0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]){
                continue;
            }
            
            int left = i+1;
            int right = nums.size() -1;
            while (left < right){
                int three_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] +nums[right];
                if(three_sum > 0){
                    right--;
                }
                else if (three_sum < 0){
                    left++;
                }
                else{
                    ans.push_back({nums[i],nums[left],nums[right]});
                    left++;
                    
                    while(nums[left] == nums[left-1] && left <right){
                        left ++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};




```

#### Major Mistakes I made
When 3Sum is found, we have to increment left pointer and additionally check if the element that left is pointing is same as the element that `left-1` is pointing. If it does and as long as left is smaller than right, increment `left` again using another loop.
```c
while(nums[left]==nums[right] && left < right ){
	left ++;
}
```

This handle edge case where more than three duplicated elements exist.
like : `nums = { 0,0,0,0 }`

In the Second Attempt :
I made a mistake by putting line 47 into 45. this line should be inside of the loop.

##### Time and Space Complexity
Sort : takes nLogN
two pointer takes n^2

Total time complexity : N^2
