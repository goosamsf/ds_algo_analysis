### Problem : 
#dp  very interesting problem that I got shocked once I realize what the solution is.
It could be thought as recursion problem using backtracking technique but  if you use bottom up dp approach, it can be really efficient yet very easy to understand.

### Problem Prompt
There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

### Approach & Analysis
>Initialize 2d `vector<int>` with all the last row and last column being 1. Fill in the vector with the `dp[i][j] = dp[row+1][col] + dp[row][col+1]`
>return `dp[0][0]`

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m,vector<int>(n,0));
        for(int i = 0; i< m; i++){
            dp[i][n-1] = 1;
        }
        
        for(int j = 0; j< n; j++){
            dp[m-1][j] = 1;
        }
        
        for(int row = m-2; row >= 0 ; row--){
            for(int col = n-2; col>= 0; col--){
                dp[row][col] = dp[row+1][col] + dp[row][col+1];
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
