### Problem Prompt
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

### Approach & Analysis
>Remember it. not sure how it works
>1. Define set containing strings in dictionary.
>2. Define DP table , size s length + 1
>3. go through string `s` from first letter to last letter
>	1.go through string `s` from first letter to outer index pointing to.
>	 > if `dp[j]` is true and `s.substr(j, i-j)` , set `dp[i]` to true and get out of the loop.
>4. return `dp[s.length()]`

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
       set<string> storage(wordDict.begin(), wordDict.end());
       vector<bool> dp(s.length()+1,false);
       dp[0] = true;
       
       for(int i = 1; i<= s.length(); i++){
           for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){
               if(dp[j] && storage.find(s.substr(j,i-j)) != storage.end()){
                   dp[i] = true;
                   break;
               }
           }
       }
        return dp[s.length()];
        
    }
};




```

#### Major Mistakes I made
You have to set the pivot in the back and then examine substring from 0 to pivot. I tried in a way that I put the pivot in front and examine the substring from pivot to the end of the string. This has failed some case where many duplicated letters are grouped together. ` tescase : [aaaaaaa] , [[aaaa,aa]]` .
The better way to traverse is to set dp[i] not dp[j]
Be care about the indexing.
