### Problem : 
very very typical #dp problem. A lot of harder dp problem are built based off this problem.
Try to come up with recurrence relation.

### Problem Prompt
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

### Approach & Analysis
>Definition : `dp[i]` the maximum amount of money the robber can get without given constraints
>Base case : `dp[0] =0` and `dp[1] =nums[0]`
  Solution : `dp[dp.size()-1]`
  Formula : Recurrence Relation
  `dp[i] = max(nums[i-1]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1])`
  
---
### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> dp(nums.size()+1, 0);
        dp[1] = nums[0];
        for(int i = 2; i<dp.size(); i++){
            dp[i] = max(nums[i-1]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1]);
        }
        
        return dp[dp.size()-1];
    }
};




```

#### Major Mistakes I made
Whenever using for loop, be wary of `offbyone` error


---
##### Time and Space Complexity
O(N)
O(N) >> Could be O(1) with just two alternating variables
#TryLaterWithOtherApproach 

```cpp
//Much faster and space efficiency
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n1=0;
        int n2 = 0;
        int temp = 0;
        for(int n : nums){
            temp = max(n+n1, n2);
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = temp;
        }
        return n2;
    }
};
```

Think carefully about the purpose of each variable. n1, n2, temp
`temp` will compare `dp[i-2]+ nums[i] and dp[i-1]`

`n1` : n1 takes
