### Problem : 
 introduction to Greedy Algorithm.
 Realized that all solution need to be prepared just in case interviewer asks specific solution. For example this problem can be solved in four different ways: dfs backtracking, top-down dp, bottom-up dp and greedy algorithm.

### Problem Prompt
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

### Approach & Analysis
> How should I come up with `goal` why the sum of index and value greater.

---
### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int goal = nums.size()-1;
        for(int i = nums.size()-1; i>=0; i--){
            if(i+nums[i] >= goal){
                goal = i;
            }
        }
        return goal==0 ? true : false;
    }
};
