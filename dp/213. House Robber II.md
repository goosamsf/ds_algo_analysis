### Problem : 
Extension of problem [[198. House Robber]]
Using same algorithm.

### Problem Prompt
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

### Approach & Analysis
>Simply, using the algorithm used in [[198. House Robber]], twice : one for `[0,nums.size-2]` and `[1, nums.size-1]`
>return max, Yet there is edge case where given list's size is 1. So if then, return `nums[0]` other wise do the things.

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() == 1){
            return nums[0];
        }
        int option1 = houseRob(nums, 0 , nums.size()-2);
        int option2 = houseRob(nums, 1, nums.size()-1);
        return max(option1, option2);
    }
    
    int houseRob(vector<int>& nums, int low, int high){
        int num1,num2;
        num1 = 0;
        num2 = 0;
        int temp = 0;
        for(int i = low; i<= high; i++){
            temp  = max(nums[i]+num1 , num2);
            num1 = num2;
            num2 = temp;
        }
        return num2;
    }
};
