### Problem :  Number of Islands


### From : Leetcode200
		#graph

### Problem Prompt
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Problem Analysis
> This is very good problem to implement dfs algorithm and bfs algorithm. DFS algorithm is recursive algorithm which mean , you have to care about "when it stops". In this case, when the row number and column number are out of bound or `grid[r][c]` has been already visited which is when `grid[r][c]` is already `0`  Also when writing leet code question answer, some problems require edge case like the input is null. So you have to care about whether or not input is null(the size of input is 0?)

### Implementation Solution
```cpp

class Solution {
    public :
        int numIslands(vector<vector<char>> & grid) {
            int nr = grid.size();
            if(!nr) {
                return 0;
            }
            int nc= grid[0].size();
            int numIslands = 0;

            for(int r=0; r< nr; r++){
                for(int c = 0; c< nc; c++) {
                    if(grid[r][c]=='1'){
                        numIslands++;
                        dfs(grid, r,c);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

      void dfs(vector<vector<char>> &grid, int r, int c ){
          int nr = grid.size();
          int nc = grid[0].size();

          if(r < 0 || c < 0 || r>= nr || c >= nc || grid[r][c]== '0'){
              return;
          }
          grid[r][c] = '0';

          dfs(grid, r+1, c);
          dfs(grid, r-1, c);
          dfs(grid, r, c+1);
          dfs(grid, r, c-1);


      }
}




```
