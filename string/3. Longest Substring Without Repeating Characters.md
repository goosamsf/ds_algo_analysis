### Problem : Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters


### From : LeetCode 3
		#string #slidingwindow
---
### Problem Prompt
Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.


---
### Problem Analysis
> This problem introduce the technique called  `sliding window` This is useful technique using two pointers. I referred it as to pointers but it doesn't have to be the "pointer" that used in c language. As long as some value represents its data through some medium, it can be considered as pointers. For example, Array's index can be considered as pointer because we can represent some value `arr[i]` through index `i` : `arr[i]` is `i`'s dereferenced value.
> So what is `sliding window` ?
> Sliding window use two pointers. One plays a role as `extending` and the other plays a role as `contractting` Using these pointers, we can address the `range`. Applying this to this problem, what we need to do is to find the range that has the longest length with given condition : `without repeating characters`. 

### Algorithm 
1. Define a data structure(map or set)
2. Define a `left`,`right` variable (Initialized to 0 )
3. Define a `answer` variable( Initialized to 0 )
4.  while `right` < `s.lenfth()` do :
	1. Define a character that the `right`  pointing in a given string.
	2. Increment the value of this character in hash map.
			 **while** the value in the Hash map is greater than 1 do :
				1. Define character that the `left` pointing in a given string
				2. Decrement the value of this character in the hash map.
				3.  Increment `left`
	3.  Compare `answer` and the current window size( right - left + 1)
	4. Increment `right`
5. return `answer`

### Implementation Solution

##### Leet Code Solution 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_set<char, int> chars;

        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;

        int res = 0;
        while (right < s.length()) {
            char r = s[right];
            chars[r]++;

            while (chars[r] > 1) {
                char l = s[left];
                chars[l]--;
                left++;
            }

            res = max(res, right - left + 1);

            right++;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
