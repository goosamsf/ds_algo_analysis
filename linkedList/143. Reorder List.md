### Problem : 
[[206. Reverse Linked List]] technique is prerequisite for this problem.

### Problem Prompt
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Approach & Analysis
> 1.Use two pointers technique, find the pivot point where after pivot point will be reversed.
> 2.end of the first half make it null
> 3. reverse second half
> 3.Merge

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head->next;
        
        while(fast && fast->next){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        
        ListNode* secondHead = slow->next;
        slow->next = NULL;  
        //reverse
        ListNode* curr = secondHead;
        ListNode* prev = NULL;
        
        while(curr){
            ListNode* nextNode = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextNode;
        }
        ListNode* first = head; 
        ListNode* second = prev;
        
        while(second){
            ListNode* temp1 = first->next;
            ListNode* temp2 = second->next;
            first->next = second;
            second->next = temp1;
            //temp1->next = temp2;
            
           first = temp1;
           second = temp2;  
        }
       }
};
