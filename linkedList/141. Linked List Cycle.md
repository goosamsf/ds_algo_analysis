### Problem :  Linked List Cycle


### From :LeetCode
		#`subject`
---
### Problem Prompt
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Problem Analysis
> The main idea is two pointers that has different speed. Imagine two people running on a circle track. If one person faster than the other, there will be a point where they meet. So if the linked list contains cycle there will be a node being pointed by two pointers.

**Why `fast` pointer is used to control the while loop?**
-> Let's be intuitive about the situation. If there is no cycle, one that reach `nullptr` first is whoever has the faster speed.

### Implementation Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
	public:
		bool hasCycle(ListNode* head){
			ListNode* slow = head;
			ListNode* fast = head;

			while(fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr){
				slow = slow -> next;
				fast = fast -> next -> next;
				if(slow == fast) {
					return true;
				}
			}
		return false;
		}
			
};



```
Notice the condition in the while loop has to be using `head`  because `head` is the one moving  faster than `slow` .
